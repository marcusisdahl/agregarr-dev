# Posterizarr integration

Agregarr can work with Posterizarr as an artwork follow-up service. After an
Arr-triggered Posterizarr job uploads artwork to Plex, Posterizarr can notify
Agregarr to update collection membership and apply the configured overlays to
that item.

For Sonarr imports, the callback can include season and episode numbers. This
lets Agregarr update the show's main poster, its season poster, and the episode
title card without running a full-library sync.

## Configure the integration

1. In Agregarr, open **Overlay System > Overlay Output Settings**, enable
   **Posterizarr Integration**, and save.
2. Copy the Agregarr API key from **Settings > General**.
3. In Posterizarr, open **Auto Triggers > Agregarr**.
4. Enable the integration and enter the Agregarr base URL and API key.
5. Use **Test connection**, then save the settings.

The URL must be reachable from the Posterizarr container. If both applications
share a Docker network, a service-name URL such as `http://agregarr:7171` can be
used. Otherwise, use the reachable address of the Agregarr host.

Posterizarr authenticates through Agregarr's normal `X-API-Key` header. The
callback endpoints are:

- `POST /api/v1/posterizarr/trigger`
- `GET /api/v1/posterizarr/status`

## Configure overlay targets

Each overlay template can target one or more artwork types:

- **Main poster** for movies and shows
- **Season poster** for TV seasons
- **Episode card** for TV episodes

Existing templates default to **Main poster**. Episode templates use a 16:9
preview and should normally use a 1920 x 1080 canvas.

The library configuration also controls which targets are included in full and
quick overlay syncs. Movie libraries only expose main posters. Show libraries
can process main, season, and episode artwork. Episode rating presets are
applied only when the episode itself has a usable IMDb rating; otherwise the
clean title card is kept or restored.

## Processing behavior

For each accepted callback, Agregarr:

1. resolves the Plex library from the root rating key;
2. adds the movie or show to matching collections and removes replaced
   placeholders;
3. resolves the requested Plex season and episode, when supplied; and
4. applies templates whose artwork targets match the resolved items.

Callbacks are queued and processed serially so they cannot race collection or
overlay jobs. Duplicate callbacks for the same root/season/episode coordinates
are coalesced for 60 seconds. The queue accepts at most 100 waiting items.
Callbacks arriving during a full collection or overlay sync, or after the queue
fills, receive a retryable response instead of accumulating unbounded work. A
full sync also declines to start while Posterizarr work is queued or running. A
Posterizarr job sends its callback only after a Plex artwork upload succeeds.

## Poster selection and metadata compatibility

When Plex is the base-poster source, Agregarr reads Plex's poster list and uses
the selected poster. Selected uploaded posters, including Posterizarr uploads,
are downloaded through Plex's content-addressed file endpoint so the exact
poster bytes are used even if another process changes the selection during a
job. If Plex omits its selected marker, Agregarr safely falls back to the
library item's current thumbnail instead of guessing among stale uploads.

Agregarr writes an ownership marker into generated JPEG metadata. Posterizarr
can recognize this marker and will not treat an Agregarr overlay as an
unmanaged poster. Reset and restore operations preserve recognized Posterizarr
ownership metadata when re-encoding artwork.

The JPEG output is deliberate: the ownership marker must be stored where
Posterizarr can read it reliably. The first overlay run after upgrading from an
older WebP-producing build re-renders and re-uploads artwork owned by Agregarr
because the output format and render hash changed. Later runs return to normal
hash-based unchanged detection.

## Manual callback example

```sh
curl -X POST http://agregarr:7171/api/v1/posterizarr/trigger \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: your-agregarr-api-key' \
  -d '{
    "ratingKey": "12345",
    "mediaType": "show",
    "title": "Example Show",
    "seasonNumber": 2,
    "episodeNumber": 5
  }'
```

The endpoint returns HTTP 202 when the item is queued or coalesced with recent
work. It returns 409 during a full sync and 429 when the queue is full; both
responses include a `Retry-After` header that callers should honor. Queue state
and the last completed result
are available from the status endpoint.
