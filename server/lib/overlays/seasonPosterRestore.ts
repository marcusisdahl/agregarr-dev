/**
 * Restore a season's original (pre-overlay) base poster to Plex, THROWING on
 * any failure of the critical restore path (missing backup, image processing,
 * or upload).
 *
 * Used by the Maintainerr season-overlay cleanup lifecycle: the caller deletes
 * the tracked metadata row + stored base poster ONLY when this resolves, so a
 * transient failure must throw to preserve recovery data for the next run.
 *
 * The stored base poster IS the recovery data, so it is read directly rather
 * than through getBasePosterForOverlay. That helper decides what counts as the
 * base by matching the live Plex poster against the row's recorded URLs, and
 * when neither matches it treats whatever Plex currently shows as the new base -
 * downloading it and overwriting the stored original. A row whose
 * `ourOverlayPosterUrl` has gone stale (the overlay upload succeeded but the
 * write recording it did not: see the swallowed catch around
 * `recordOverlayApplicationWithBasePoster` in OverlayLibraryService) lands in
 * exactly that branch, so the "restore" would re-upload our own countdown
 * poster, overwrite the real base with it, and report success - after which
 * cleanup deletes the row and the file. Reading the backup directly cannot
 * mistake an overlay for a base.
 *
 * What that costs: if a user manually replaced the season's poster in Plex
 * AFTER the overlay was applied, this reverts to the pre-overlay original
 * instead of keeping their replacement. Rare, and they can simply set it again.
 * Baking a countdown into the poster and destroying the only copy of the base
 * is neither rare enough nor reversible.
 *
 * A missing backup throws. The caller keeps the row and retries, which is the
 * one deliberate divergence from Maintainerr's revertItemInternal (which clears
 * state and stops tracking). The poster is stuck either way; only keeping the
 * row can still heal if the file comes back.
 *
 * Label removal is best-effort: the poster upload IS the recovery, so a failed
 * "Overlay" label removal is logged but does not block cleanup. Throwing on it
 * would re-run a full restore every cleanup pass for a cosmetic label - the
 * delete/recreate churn this codebase avoids elsewhere. The trade is that a
 * label whose removal fails is orphaned once the caller drops the row.
